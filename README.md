copy the .env example file to .env

run

yarn install

yarn start

starts the api, from there

yarn start-client

to develop changes to the front end, if you run

yarn build

the api should be able to supply the front end via whatever the api port number is

if you dm me, i will probably will give you some login credentials to my database for you to use for testing purposes.
